2. NEXT--> CSS resets
3a. Sidebar size, content size, general heights
3. Sidebar background
4. Sidebar logo block and position
4b. Sidebar footer text re image attribution
5. content block top block, line up with logo
6. background of content block
7. basic form styling
8. button styling





Notes:
* unsure if we should have a body container as well as a content container
* unsure how to get the sidebar working with flex but shouldn't be too difficult



Checking against other solutions:
* How was logo done? img and p tags?
* How was sidebar footer image attribution positioned?
